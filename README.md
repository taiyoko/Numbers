# Numbers
Java console program that generates numbers in a lotto quick-pick style, written for Data Structures course

This program uses no command-line arguments. When it is run, it asks for an integer between 1 and 5. It then generates that many sets of random numbers in a Powerball-style:
 *Subgroup A: 5 numbers between 1-69 inclusive, no duplicates.
 *Subgroup B: 1 number between 1-26 inclusive, can be a duplicate of a number from Subgroup A.
 
 These numbers are then printed to the system output. Upon completion, it asks the user if they want additional numbers generated.
